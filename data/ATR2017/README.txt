Airport statistics were taken from the Port Authority of NY/NJ website. Specifically: https://www.panynj.gov/airports/pdf-traffic/ATR2017.pdf. Tables were copied from the PDF report into notepad files.

The names of the files came from the titles of the pages. Headlines with annotative notes were changed to just use asterisks (so we wouldn't have to deal with any encoding issues)
